Stuff to fix/implement later:

- README.
- Tell the user when the version installed is the newest one available.
- Pretty UI.
  - Make it visible when a folder has already been selected.
- Indicate how many files were written to disk and show a checkmark or something.
- Manifest file, favicon and opengraph.
- PWA and service worker with skipWaiting.
- Later, remove all the @ts-expect-error, when the required new types are in typescript.
